symphony-ssh
============

Description
------------

This is a small collection of base classes used for interacting with
remote machines over ssh.  With them, you can use AMQP (via Symphony) to
run batch commands, execute templates as scripts, and perform any
batch/remoting stuff you can think of without the need of a separate
client agent.

These classes assume you have a user that can connect and login to
remote machines using a password-less ssh keypair.  They are not meant
to be used directly.  Subclass them!

See the rdoc for additional information and examples.


Options
-------

Symphony-ssh uses
[Configurability](https://rubygems.org/gems/configurability) to determine
behavior.  The configuration is a [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) file. 

    symphony:
        ssh:
            path: /usr/bin/ssh
            user: root
            key: /path/to/a/private_key.rsa
            opts:
              - -e
              - none
              - -T
              - -x
              - -o
              - CheckHostIP=no'
              - -o
              - BatchMode=yes'
              - -o
              - StrictHostKeyChecking=no

**NOTE**: If you've upgrade from a version pre 0.2.0, the
Configurability path has changed from `symphony_ssh`, to an `ssh` key
under the `symphony` top level.


### path

The absolute path to the ssh binary.

### user

The default user to connect to remote hosts with.  This can be
changed per connection in the AMQP payload.

### key

An absolute path to a password-less ssh private key.

### opts

SSH client options, passed to the ssh binary on the command line.  Note
that the defaults have been tested fairly extensively, these are just
exposed if you have very specific needs and you know what you're doing.


Installation
-------------

    gem install symphony-ssh


Contributing
------------
